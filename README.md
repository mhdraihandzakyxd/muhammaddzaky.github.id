There are types, subgenres, durations, and also audience reviews. So, read the discussion to the end, yes!
Some of you may be aware that anime not only has genres, but also has subgenres (supporting genres). Anime subgenres are quite diverse, such as comedy, action, romantic, drama, music, school, and fantasy. In addition, there are also subgenres seinen (adult male), josei (adult female), shounen (male), and shoujo (female).
The main purpose of anime having many subgenres is so that the audience has an idea of ​​the story being presented. Besides that, it is also easier for viewers to find the genre they want to watch.
Choose the type of anime to watch
In general, anime types can be divided into two, namely original and adaptation. What are the differences between the two types of anime? Come on, check the discussion below!
2.Original, original work made directly by the studio
Some of you may still feel unfamiliar with the term anime original. This type of anime is usually made directly by an artist or animator with an animation studio. So, this type of anime is not an adaptation of a novel or manga. The Garden of Words is an example of an original anime. The anime was written and directed by Makoto Shinkai and produced by CoMix Wave Films.
Even though it's an original anime, you may find the title in other forms, such as a novel or manga. The novel is usually made after film production. However, the time of publication is done faster (a few days or a few weeks before the film is out). Original anime is rarely found because some anime studios in Japan don't produce much.
3.Adaptation, for those of you who want to see the visualization
Furthermore, there are anime adaptations that are lifted from comics or novels. So, when the film is released, some people who have read it may have an idea of ​​the anime because they have seen the visualization. Anime studios usually don't work on all of the existing chapters, but some do until the end of the chapter.
The types of comics produced by anime studios are quite diverse. However, shounen comics (favored by men) are the ones that are widely adapted into anime. Shounen comics have a male main character and the stories presented usually contain action, heroism, friendship, and comedy.
4. Consider reviews from other viewers
If you are still confused in choosing slice of life anime, try paying attention to reviews from other viewers. By looking at reviews from other viewers, you will get an idea of ​​the anime's storyline. Other viewers' reviews can also predict your suitability, especially for those of you who are new to the anime world.
However, you also have to be careful because sometimes audience reviews contain spoilers that can dampen enthusiasm. Therefore, you just have to skim or just look at the rating. You can also check out some discussion forums on the internet if you need more information about an anime.
Check the duration of the anime that suits your free time
The average anime is made in the format of a film (movie) or series. In this case, you can choose an anime whose duration matches your free time. So you can enjoy the story without being distracted by other activities.
5.Film, immediately finished and free of curiosity

Anime film format does take quite a long time. However, you will not be curious about the continuation of the story.
Anime in the film category makes it easier for you to estimate the time to watch and is suitable to be enjoyed when you have free time. This type of anime is indeed shorter and does not contain too many conflicts. Even so, the storyline is no less interesting than the series and several anime titles have conflicts that stir feelings.
6. The series, the continuation of the story makes the audience curious
Anime series usually have many episodes (ranging from dozens to thousands of episodes). Some anime series titles even consist of several seasons so that the time needed to watch it becomes longer. Therefore, anime series is more suitable for those of you who have a lot of free time to watch.
If you don't want to watch a long series, a mini series that has fewer episodes can be considered. Also, don't forget to find out if the series is over or is it still on going. Some people who don't like to be curious generally prefer to wait for the anime series to end first. After that, the anime will be watched in a marathon in a few days.
